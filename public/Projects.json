      "title": "Vehicle Accident Detection and Prevention System",
      "description": "Built a two-part IoT and computer vision system combining ESP32-based hardware simulation in Wokwi (with MPU6050 IMU, OLED display, buzzer, LED alerts) and a Python drowsiness detection module using OpenCV and dlib. The CV module captures webcam frames, computes Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), and triggers real-time alerts when drowsiness is detected, integrating ThingSpeak for data logging and Twilio for SMS notifications to prevent accidents through proactive driver monitoring."

      "title": "Carpool Coordination System",
      "description": "Designed and developed a full-stack Carpool Coordination System using React, TypeScript, Prisma ORM, and PostgreSQL, featuring OAuth login, and structured search across three levels (office, street, and city) to connect commuters across California. Built a multi-stage matching algorithm that enables users to send, accept, or reject carpool requests, supports progressive pairing (same office/street/city) and secure formation of 2- or 3-person groups with real-time validation of mutual connections."

      "title": "GPU Telemetry Profiling for AI Workloads",
      "description": "Benchmarked NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU performance and energy behavior during AI inference workloads (ResNet-18, TinyLlama 1.1B, Stable Diffusion v1.5). Used nvidia-smi telemetry to analyze power draw, GPU utilization, and latency metrics, demonstrating energy–performance tradeoffs and achieving up to 0.9 inferences per watt. Research conducted at iConsult Collaborative, Syracuse University."

      "title": "Water Heater Alerting System",
      "description": "This project is a water heating alert system using Bolt IoT and Twilio. It continuously monitors water temperature through sensors, fetching real-time data from the Bolt Cloud. If the temperature exceeds predefined thresholds, it sends SMS alerts to prevent overheating, ensuring safety and efficient boiler operation through automated monitoring."

      "title": "Online Course Registration System",
      "description": "Developed as part of my DBMS project at Bangalore Institute of Technology, this web platform, built with HTML, CSS, Angular, JavaScript, and MySQL Backend Server, was tested in a live DBMS course. It enabled 70+ students to register, while the professor managed enrollment, assignments, and tracking, demonstrating real-time database integration, automation, and scalability in education."

      "title": "Environmental Weather Station using AWS IoT Core, Thingspeak, AWS S3 and Lambda",
      "description": "Designed and implemented a cloud-based IoT simulation pipeline that securely published simulated environmental data (temperature, humidity, and CO₂) to AWS IoT Core via MQTT and stored it in AWS S3 for long-term retrieval, providing hands-on experience in cloud architecture, real-time data ingestion, and IoT system functionality."
