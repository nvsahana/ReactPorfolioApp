      "title": "Autmatic Hate Speech Detection system",
      "description": "This study focuses on hate speech detection using a novel ensemble model applied to a bilingual Twitter dataset. The approach involves TFIDF vectorization for feature extraction, considering multiple classification methods (Decision tree, SVC, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes), and comparing various ensemble combinations. The final ensemble model, combining Support Vector Classifier and Random Forest, achieves an impressive 91% accuracy when tested against the dataset.",
